- add README
- add man page
- add LICENSE
- check child(before signal sending) ppid?
- add restart settings(intensity and period settings - if we exceed this, sv exits)
- support for many children?
- script control with unix domain socket instead of FIFO(we must see the sv answer to our commands)
- ping command(send ping to a child)
- add child keepalive
- if can't receive a reply from a child to sent command longer than some timeout, then
  restart it. Now we send SIGTERM and if a child do not reply to us, we do nothing.
  We should fix this by sending a SIGKILL, if a child do not terminated after SIGTERM.
